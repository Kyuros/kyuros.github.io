            <p><b>Scientific figures are an important piece of any publication</b>. Good figures can draw a reader's attention. They are made to convey complex information at a glance. Almost any publication with data analysis has some sort of figure. They take advantage of our ability to easily recognize patterns (trends, gaps, outliers). Conversely, poor graphics can lead to confusing or misleading interpretations. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the basics in creating coherent and engaging figures!</p>

            <p><b>Data visualization is becoming more important with the ever-increasing availability of data</b>. There is also a growing emphasis on data-driven decision making. Visualizing data can communicate different insights, trends, and patterns effectively. Industries like journalism, healthcare, engineering, and education can make use of data visualization for various purposes.</p>

            <p><b>Figures can serve a variety of functions.</b> They can go beyond charts and graphs to convey concepts that are difficult to convey with only words or might be too lengthy to explain.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Gain insight into exploratory data analysis</li>
                <li>Document and visualize results from experiments</li>
                <li>Checking data quality and structure before use</li>
                <li>Making comparisons between data</li>
                <li>Form inferences about the data</li>
                <li>Identifying outliers</li>
                <li>Visualize complex methodologies</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>What does a figure contain?</b> There are a few components that make up a figure. <i>Schematics and diagrams</i> are used to convey concepts that are difficult to explain with words alone. <i>Data</i> includes the findings your conclude from your study. <i>Captions</i> provide the necessary details to understand or to guide understanding of the figure. Lastly, the first sentence summarizes the figure.</p>

            <p><b>What does this guide offer?</b> In this guide, I will provide a handful of key steps to help improve your scientific figures! We start with 5 basic rules to enhance your figure creation. Then, we delve into more involved topics.</p>

            <h2 class="font-weight-light title" id="tips">General Figure Tips & Tricks</h2>
            <p> </p>

            <h2>1. Define your purpose and stick with it</h2>

            <p><b>What is the purpose of my figure?</b> This is the first question you should ask yourself. Figures in scientific publication should serve a concrete purpose. Whether to show a complex pipeline, summarize results, visualizing the methodology, the figure should have a purpose.</p>

            <p><b>Adapt your figures to the medium you present your work.</b></p>

            <h2>2. Pick an appropriate visualization and composition</h2>
            <h2>3. Use color for emphasis</h2>
            <h2>4. Choose an appropriate font and make it consistent</h2>
            <h2>5. Keep the figures as simple as possible</h2>
